## ABCD: Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study

The ABCD Study is the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. The ongoing ABCD Research Consortium has 21 research sites across the country. It will collect longitudinal data in 11,880 children starting at 9–10 years and follow up 10 years, with longitudinal scans every two years. The collected neuroimaging includes structural (T1, T2, and diffusion scans) and functional (rest, monetary incentive delay task, stop signal task and the emotional N-back task) MRI, with an emphasis on understanding the precursors to addictive behavior.

## ABIDE: Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange Initiative

The ABIDE initiative has aggregated functional and structural brain imaging data collected from laboratories around the world to accelerate our understanding of the neural bases of autism. It now includes two large-scale collections: ABIDE I and ABIDE II, each has over 1,000 subjects (age range: 5~64).

## ADHD200:

A consortium of the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI), the ADHD-200 Sample is a collaboration of 8 international imaging sites that have aggregated and are openly sharing neuroimaging data from 362 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and 585 typically developing controls (age: 7-21 years). These 947 datasets are composed of structural and resting state functional MRI data along with phenotypic information.



## HCP-D: Human Connectome Project-Development

The HCP-D is a cross-sectional study, which has extended the adult HCP study to examine the brain connectome in 1300 children 5–21 years of age. There is a subset of individuals 9–17 years of age receiving repeat scans to capture changes across puberty. T1, T2, DWI and fMRI are available.

## HBN: Healthy Brain Network Biobank

The HBN Biobank intends to provide the a large-scale dataset of 10,000 participants aged 5-21 through an open data-sharing model. The aggregated database will bring multimodal brain imaging, genetics, and biological samples together with a standardized deep phenotyping protocol that spans a broad range of clinically relevant psychiatric, behavioral, cognitive, and lifestyle information.

## IMAGEN

The IMAGEN study, a European based consortium, collected longitudinal structural and functional MRI data, genetics and behavioral assessments from 2000 adolescents at ages 14, 16, 19 and 22 years.

## NCANDA: National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence study

The NCANDA study is examining risk factors for drinking within an adolescent population (N = 808; 12–21 years) and includes psychosocial measures in addition to structural and functional MRI measures.


## PING: Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition and Genetics Study

The PING study collected 735 structural scans (T1, T2, and diffusion scans) and resting functional MRI in children aged 4–21 years.

## PNC: Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort

The PNC study, which is cross-sectional, included 1000 children aged 8–21 years and collected structural (T1, T2 and diffusion scans) and functional MRI sequences during rest, a fractal N-back task and an emotion identification task, in combination with genetic information that was gathered previously from these children.
